               ---------------------------------------------

  Thankyou very much for your registration: I am very grateful.  Your
  registration ID is:

        Name:  Michael Driscoll

        ID  :  PZYNVQYPDNNH

  Once you have entered this (from the Register option under the Game menu
  item) the annoying dialog box will be disabled and two new features will be
  added to the basic game.  These are:

  a) Mermaid

     This lovely lady just longs to be saved!  If you can locate her then pick
     her up in the sub and reap the rewards of 1000 points, bonus ship and a
     bonus scatter bomb.  Should you accidently (or otherwise) shoot her then
     you lose 1000 points.

  b) Rubber Ring

     Could prove very useful to you....

  I hope that you have a sound card to reap the benefits of the sounds 
  associated with these features, since they're definitely the best sounds in
  the game.

  I would be very pleased to hear from you if you have any suggestions for
  new features or enhancements for a next release.  Your registration ID 
  will be valid for all future releases of Aquanaut! and I shall notify
  you when a new version is available and when I produce another game.  I
  have a number of ideas, just a matter of finding the time to get it done!

  I can be reached either at my home address of:

        2003 N. Swinton Avenue,
        Delray Beach,
        FL 33444.

  or by e-mail to:

  Thankyou once again for registering,

  Paul Stanley.
